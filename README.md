This is simply used to store some data for a clan on Roblox called Crucio. Integrates with the Roblox API, but the source code shall remain closed-source, as it is property of a clan.
If you are the owner and have permission to edit, TO EDIT THE DATA:
DO THIS:

Go to this website (or any other json prettifier)
https://jsonlint.com/
Then, paste in the JSON data from index.json,
Prettify it and modify the data to your liking.
The Data inside is key-value of UserId and then their respective data. Be careful not to mix up the typing for any of the data values, otherwise it shall break and data
for that user may be wiped. (you can roll back versions by deleting entire blocks, or just looking at a player's past data.)

Once you're finished modifying,
"Uglify" it, aka "compress" it, and then push it back into the repository.
